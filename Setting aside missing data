## Setting aside missing data
For the response of ' Were you born in the United States?', I coded out missing data.

<code>
print 'Were you born in the United States? '
print 'counts for original H1GI11'
I11 = data1['H1GI11'].value_counts(sort=True, dropna=False)
print(I11)

<output>
Were you born in the United States? 
counts for original H1GI11
1    4807
7    1293
0     399
8       3
6       2
Name: H1GI11, dtype: int64

<code description>
0 no
1 yes [skip to Q.15]
6 refused [skip to Q.15]
7 legitimate skip [lived at current address since birth]
8 donâ€™t know [skip to Q.15]

<code>
# recode missing values to python missing (NaN)
data1['H1GI11']=data1['H1GI11'].replace(6, np.nan)
data1['H1GI11']=data1['H1GI11'].replace(8, np.nan)

#if you want to include a count of missing add ,dropna=False  
print 'counts for H1GI11 with 6/8 set to NAN and number of missing requested'
I11a = data1['H1GI11'].value_counts(sort=True, dropna=False)
print(I11a)

<output> 
1.000000    4807
7.000000    1293
0.000000     399
